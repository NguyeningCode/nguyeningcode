### WordPress Theme + Material Design

![Materialist](http://fikrirasy.id/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/materialist-featured.jpg)
> Materialist is WordPress theme which is (obviously) inspired by Material Design

## The Origin

The development of Materialist was started in January 2015. Materialist is made to display chronological list of posts efficiently using Material Design.

Personally, I envision Materialist as ideal theme for a blog which contains list of things / ideas such as [idea.fikrirasy.id](http://idea.fikrirasy.id) (disclaimer: the blog is mine).

## The Goals

Materialist is made with these goals in mind:

1. Looks great in all screen
2. Implement Material Design effectively
3. Ideal for blog which its “list of posts” need to be scanned quickly
4. In months to come (after several iteration), I personally wish that Materialist reaches a level where Automattic theme would love to use it on WordPress.com


## Features

Besides its clean looking inspired by Material Design, Materialist comes with these features:

1. Responsive design using mobile first approach. Materialist looks great in all device
2. Select one “color accent” through Customizer then Materialist will generate color scheme for your site
3. Looks great right from the start. No quirky setup needed.
4. Widget support on drawer.

## Plugin Compatibilities

Materialist works nicely with these plugins:

1. [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/)’s Infinite Scroll
2. [Civil Footnotes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/civil-footnotes/)


## See it Yourself
