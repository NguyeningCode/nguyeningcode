                <br />
                <h5>Google Cloud Support (IC)</h5>
                <p>I built an internal tool that automatically synced groups between internal systems daily. <b>This resulted in a reduction of 250+ FTE hours per day.</b> The difficulty in building this tool was making it super modular while building on top of a brand new internal stack that was being built in parallel. As a result of the work I've done, it is compatible with many different internal ACL systems and can be extended quite easily. Due to my early engagement with this new internal stack, I was involved with writing some core functionalities for this new stack (now known as Integration Platform).</p>
                <p>In addition, I was involved in Google Cloud Support, primarily on the chat side. I was responsible for enhancing the agent experience when it came to getting chat cases and was involved in updating it for Lightning, as well as routing and some automation on case creation.</p>
                <h5>CLM Team (Tech Lead)</h5>
                <p>I was brought on as a <b>tech lead for a team of 15+ developers</b> and <b>successfully launched/landed CLM</b> within Google Cloud, with a user base of approximately 300+ users. While on the project, I was responsible for driving both the work and direction of the project alongside my director and project managers to meet the needs of our internal users. Throughout the project, <b>I reviewed around 400 CLs and authored 90+ CLs in the span of 6 months while on this project.</b> In addition, I was responsible for the deployment and go-live of the project in over 9 environments. <b>When I was brought onto the project, it was in a code red status</b>, and they were unlikely to finish on time. Within the original timeline, I was able to <b>reverse that into a code green project status with 0 P0 issues within the first few months.</b></p>
                <h5>Verily - Project Baseline [CoVID-19] (Volunteer)</h5>
                <p>I built the SFDC instance for <a href="https://projectbaseline.com" >Project Baseline</a>, which provided CoVID-19 screens and information. We were able to do the entire implementation within a week. My contributions were to implement the foundations for <b>supporting over 200QPS for the site to go live nationwide</b> as well as some of the SFDC setup to automate and handle cases for people looking to schedule visits and get more information.</p>
                <h5>Integration Platform (IC)</h5>
                <p>I was the <b>go-to expert for Salesforce</b> among my peers and regularly helped <b>over 10 customers with Salesforce implementations</b>, as well as integrations into other parts of Google. I also wrote some core logic on the backend for the product, notably a <b>JSON to RPC converter</b> to build the backbone for the Apps Script team to enable custom logic using Apps Script on our platform. As part of the backend team, I was responsible for maintaining several backend servers and was involved in doing server maintenance and configurations. </p>

                <h4>Lead Salesforce Developer</h4>
                <br />
                <p>As part of the BizApps team, I built deployment tools for the team using ANT scripts, Bash scripts,
                  and SFDX to <b>improve efficiency and quality of life for developers</b>. I also was responsible for
                  creating the Github repo for our SFDC code which allowed us to do version control better.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My work enabled Doordash to reach out to <b>100% of their social media comments for both Facebook and
                    Twitter</b>, as well as open cases through comments or tags. This resulted in an <b>increase of CSAT
                    scores across the board</b>, as customers had multiple avenues in order to reach out to support. We
                  accomplished this by setting up Social Studio for SFDC and created pre-filled cases with case routing
                  assignments in order to route these requests to the correct agents. We also worked on chat support and
                  enabled load balancing on chat to send chat messages to agents based on their availability. This
                  <b>led to a reduction of around 40-50% load on agents</b>, especially during peak hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Developed end-to-end integration that did bi-directional sync between internal systems and SFDC.
                  <b>The initial version reduced labor by a few days per case (averaged several thousand cases per
                    month).</b> With the integration, we were able to automatically populate info both on the Salesforce
                  side as well as our backend Django infrastructure, which reduced manual input and errors that are
                  normally associated with those. In addition, because this was all automated, <b>the process to onboard
                    a restaurant used to take days</b>, and the automation <b>brought that time down to around 10
                    minutes average</b> in order to get a restaurant ready for onoarding. <b>This reduced the workload
                    by roughly 55 FTE per month</b></p>

                    biology, wrote peer-reviewed level articles,</b> performed many experiments, improved research
                  skills, and
                  perfected lab techniques. <b>Learned techniques like DNA replciation through PCR, gel electrophoresis,
                    and Northern blots.</b>
